# Description

This Logo makerr was created to allow developers to create logos for their projects, by answering some basic questions. the inquirer module was use to set questions. Other tools used and steps taken were:

* Javascript to write to set shape and color
* Node.js
* Run tests using nmp juest
* Timely commits to GitHub repository to save work

This project allowed me more opportunity to garner more experience using inquirer. I also got the chance to get more intuned with how JavaScript, nodeJS and inquirer works together to complete projects.
